# MazeGenerator-DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

## Overview

MazeGenerator is a Java application developed as part of the Fall'22 semester project. It is capable of generating random mazes and solving them using various data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- Generates random mazes
- Solves generated mazes
- Visualization of maze generation and solving processes

## Data Structures and Algorithms Implemented

This project incorporates over 10 data structure concepts, including but not limited to:

- **Arrays**: Used for storing maze cells and states.
- **Linked Lists**: Utilized for path tracking and backtracking during maze solving.
- **Stacks**: Implemented in Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
- **Queues**: Used in Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
- **Trees**: For representing and traversing the maze structure.
- **Graphs**: The maze itself is treated as a graph where cells are nodes and paths are edges.
- **Heaps**: For optimizing pathfinding algorithms.
- **Hash Maps**: To efficiently store and retrieve maze cell states.
- **Priority Queues**: Used in algorithms like Dijkstra’s for shortest path finding.
- **Recursion**: For recursive backtracking in maze generation and solving.

## Algorithms

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: For maze generation and solving.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For alternative maze solving approach.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: For finding the shortest path in the maze.
- **Recursive Backtracking**: For maze generation.
